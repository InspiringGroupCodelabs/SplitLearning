# Split Learning with a Relay Server

Simple MNIST Machine Learning code in three ways: 
1. Normal: sequential code to train and test an MNIST model (no split, no sockets)
2. Split: Split learning code to train and test an MNIST model (no sockets)

# Running Locally

## 1: Regular MNIST code

run src/no_split/mnist.py

## 2: Split Learning (no sockets) code

run src/split_no_socket/splitlearning_mnist.py
